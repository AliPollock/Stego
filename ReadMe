################## To Change maximum Message Length

Programme will accept a maximum binary message of length 134,217,727 i.e 27 binary digits long

If you would like to use the programme to take a larger message, the following changes must be made:

In the Writer File:

In the insertMessageLengthIntoImage() function:
    the zfill(27) must be changed to a larger multiple of 3 such as zfill(30)
    the range of x values must be changed reflect this change, so for zfill(x):range(9) must be changed to range(x/3)

In the Reader File:

In the extractMessageLengthFromImage() function:
    the range must be changed to the same as in the writer file: range(9) -> range(x/3)
